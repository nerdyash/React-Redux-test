This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About this Project
1. Create a multi component React/Redux app to process results from a public API -  http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts (React/Redux SPA)
2. Provide ability for user to search the JSON data by title.
3. Results of user search should be presented on the page.
4. Provide ability for user to select an entry from the results and have it populate an edit form.
5. Provide ability for user to type the title of an entry in the edit form and have it populate the form.
6. Provide ability for user to edit the entry and have it saved in the local Redux store. (the edited entry should be presented on subsequent searches until page reload)
7. incorporate auto-complete to predict what the user will type next for the title
